# CoCoDragon-MultiPakInterface-CC-Multi-Pak_Version_1.2
CoCoDragon-MultiPakInterface-CC-Multi-Pak_Version_1.2 - This is a clone of the Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer Multi-Pak Interface #26-3024 (which should also be compatible with the #26-3124). This was designed by my nephew "Little John" and his father "Big John" (J.R. as he is known to me). I have made very minor modifications to it. "Little John" designed this thing to work with ATX Power Supplies, which makes sense I guess - that is the most common power supply in the whole of the known universe. Please note that I have not yet tested this but I am ordering boards and will post an update after initial testing has been completed.
