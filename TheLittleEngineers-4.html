<hr>
<b>Introducing "The R.A.T.": </b>I have started 
writing this introduction numerous times only to get sidetracked and derailed. Hopefully, I 
will be able to  properly introduce myself this time. I will start at the beginning of my 
computer usage. This would be March 30, 1982. My fourteenth birthday. My parents presented 
me with a <b>Timex Sinclair 1000 (TS1000)</b> computer, after much begging and pleading. The 
<b>TS1000</b> is a <b>ZX81</b> with a few differences: 2K of RAM, an [ENTER] key instead of 
[NEW LINE] or [N/L] and Timex branding. I had wanted a computer for so long, and <b>Sir Clive 
Sinclair</b> succeeded in making it affordable. Timex made it even more affordable as the 
<b>TS1000</b> was placed on sale for $59.99 at the local "Big B" drug store, at the time, a 
division of Brunos Corporation (Food World, Food Fair, Consumer Warehouse, etcetera). I was 
ectstatic - I finally had a computer, limited as it was, I still learned a great deal from 
that machine and it led to the creation of <b>Zombie Software Systems</b>, my first computer 
venture. When Timex announced the <b>Timex Sinclair 2068 (TS2068)</b> after cancelling the 
<b>TS2000</b> (a <b>48K Spectrum</b> clone), I knew that I wanted it to be my next computer 
and my parents agreed to buy it for me for Christmas of 1983. Then, it happened: I walked 
into the local franchised Radio Shack store, operated at the time by Cisco Auto Parts, and 
there, on display right next to the entrance, was the newly introduced <b>Color Computer 2 
with 16K and Extended Color BASIC</b>. It took mere moments for me to fall in love with that 
machine and I asked my parents for the <b>Color Computer 2</b> instead of the <b>TS2068</b>. 
They placed it on lay-a-way as Christmas approached. It was eventually paid off and sat under 
the Christmas tree until Christmas Evening of 1983. They allowed me to open it on Christmas 
Evening and I was up all night working through the programs in the manuals. It was wonderful. 
This led to the creation of <b>Binary Systems</b>, my second computer venture. Eventually, I 
came across an advertisement in Radio-Electronics from a company by the name of Unicorn 
Electronics. They had a set of 4164 Dynamic RAM chips with a 150nS access time for, I think 
$9.95. The chips were used but tested. I ordered them, along with a bag of keyboard switches 
(intended to be used for buildinmg a better keyboard for my <b>TS1000</b>). When they arrived, 
I opened the case of my <b>Color Computer 2</b>, installed the 64K chips, soldered in the W1 
jumper and voila - I had a <b>64K ECB Color Computer 2</b>. Although other systems of the 
time had better graphics and sound, the <b>Color Computer</b> line of systems by Radio Shack, 
a division of Tandy Corporation, would become (and remain) my favorite computers of all time. 
In fact, I still use them to this very day, having kept one <b>Color Computer 3 (CoCo 3)</b> 
when I passed my vintage computing collection to my brother, J.R. (John Robert) who then passed 
it on to his son, "Little John" (John Eric), but I will get to that after a brief reminiscence 
of <b>ZSS</b> and <b>BS</b>, as follows:<br>
<b>
   <center>ZSS or Zombie Software Systems:</center>
   <br>Zombie Software Systems
</b>
was formed on my fourteenth birthday, 30 March 1982, as a sole 
proprietorship supporting the Timex and Sinclair computer systems. Supported systems initially 
included:
<ul>
   <li>Sinclair ZX80</li>
   <li>Sinclair ZX81</li>
   <li>Timex Sinclair 1000</li>
</ul>
Support was eventually added for:

   <li>Sinclair Spectrum (All Versions)</li>
   <li>Timex Sinclair 2068</li>
   <li>Sinclair QL</li>
</ul>
By 1991, and in conjunction with Binary Systems, support had been added for machines from Mattel, 
Atari, Tomy, Texas Instruments, Tandy Radio Shack, Commodore and many others.<br><br>
<b>

      BS or Binary Systems:
   </center>
   <br>Binary Systems
</b>
was formed on 23 December 1983, as a sole 
proprietorship supporting the Tandy Radio Shack computer systems. Supported systems initially 
included:
<ul>
   <li>TRS-80 Color Computer (CoCo 1)</li>
   <li>Tandy Data Products TDP-100</li>
   <li>TRS-80 Color Computer 2 (CoCo 2)</li>

   <li>TRS-80 Model IV</li>
   <li>TRS-80 Model 4/4P</li>

</ul>
By 1991, and in conjunction with Zombie Software Systems, support had been added for machines from 
Mattel, Atari, Tomy, Texas Instruments, Sinclair, Commodore, Amstrad, Kaypro and many others. The 
operation of <b>Zombie Software Systems</b> and <b>Binary Systems</b> was a <b>labor of love</b> 
more than anything else, as it never made a profit, but it was fun and remains among the best 
memories of my youth and early adulthood and I am thankful that the stroke (see below) did not take 
these memories from me.
<hr>
I continued to support these vintage machines until 2007 when I suffered 
a stroke. At that point, I passed operations on to my son, John (he and his cousin share both the 
same name and same date of birth through a very odd coincidence). My son eventually made a mess of 
things and finally moved on to other hobbies. A side effect of the stroke was that I lost all 
interest in computers and electronics, vintage and otherwise. It was thus that I presented my entire 
collection of vintage computers and electronics to my brother J.R. (John Robert or "Big John"). He 
took the opportunity to bond with his son, J.E. (John Eric or "Little John"). "Little John" was 
facing a number of health issues, but he jumped in with both feet, teaching himself all about the 
<b>Color Computer</b> and other systems. He began to develop a plethora of hardware projects for the 
<b>Color Computer</b> and other vintage systems. The earliest of his design were rubbish due to his 
lack of skill, but he appears to have learned rather quickly, producing some amazing designs. I have 
taken it upon myself to "redo" his earliest works, hopefully producing manufacturable products from 
them. The first of his designs to receive the "redesign" treatment from me is the "FlexiMIDI" and 
"FlexiROM" projects. Those two designs were excellent in concept, but rubbish in practice due to his 
lack of circuit design skills at the time that he developed them. They are certainly worth the time 
and effort to redesign. He would eventually become disillusioned and abandon the hobby altogether. 
This was, in no small part, due to hackers repeatedly taking down his website: 
<a href="http://www.GIMEchip.com/">GIMEchip.com</a>. They (the unknown hackers) eventually compromised 
his eBay and PayPal accounts, rendering them completely useless. That was the straw that broke the 
camels back, so to speak. He ("Little John") gave up and moved to Tennessee. He left everything with 
his father, my brother, and asked that his father release all of his works as open source. J.R. made 
several valiant efforts to honor that request, but never fully succeeded in releasing all of the works 
of "Little John". Fast Forward almost a decade...<br>
<hr>
<b>The Beginning of a Family Tragedy:</b><br>November of 2018, my father fell ill and was hospitalized. 
As Christmas approached, he remained in the hospital. Many family members visited and it came to pass 
that I reconnected with J.R. and "Little John". They asked me if I would like to have my old vintage 
computing collection back. At first, I was hesitant and uninterested. As my fathers condition worsened, 
I began to remember how hard my father worked to buy me those first computers. Tons of memories, good 
and bad, began to flood my mind. I decided to accept their offer. In addition to the hardware and 
software, they presented me with the <a href="http://www.GIMEchip.com/">GIMEchip.com</a> domain name. 
This became my Christmas present from my brother and his son. "Little John" asked that I finish what 
his father started: <i>the release of all of "Little John's" work as open source</i>. I reluctantly 
agreed, though I was unsure if I could ever manage the time and effort to do so. I honestly was not 
prepared to take on such a monumental task. Then, <b>tragedy</b> struck.<br><br>On the day of 
January 4, 2019, my father died as I held his hand in that hospital room. His death had quite a profound 
effect on me. I almost lost my job while trying to come to terms with never being able to speak to my father 
again. I eventually began to recover, to an extent, but I began to think of everything and everyone that I 
had lost over the years. For one thing, my own son, also named John Eric Turner, and I are estranged. We 
"speak" online, but I have not seen him in a very long time. He was unable to be at the hospital and did 
not get to say goodbye to my father before he died. As mentioned, my son and his cousin are both named 
John Eric Turner, and there is a story behind it, however, for the moment, suffice it to say that they 
both were named In Memory of Jon-Erik Hexum, who died on the set of "Cover Up" on Friday, October 12, 
1984. As my mind wandered, I thought of my mother in law, Sarah Ann Channell, who passed away on 
January 12, 2003 and my father in law, Frank Leon Channell, who passed away on August 23, 2003. Even 
though I was divorced from their daughter, they were still family and their deaths were very painful to 
me and my son. Indeed, their deaths affected my son in such a way that he never fully recovered and that 
is partially what eventually led to our falling out in 2007 or 2008 and the resulting estrangement. I am 
sure that my addled state after that stroke also played a hand in the troubles between my son 
and I because I became very difficult to be around. Thinking about Sarah and Frank caused me to really 
begin missing my son and, even more, my father. I then thought about my best friend from high school, 
David Ray Poe, who died on May 20, 2013. Eight days prior to his death, he had sent me an email that I 
did not see until after he died. That email was a single sentence: "Did you die?". You can perhaps imagine 
the effect that reading the message had on me. In reality, he would often send a message like that when he 
had not heard from me in a while. Another close friend from high school, Steve Allen cox, died on September 
6, 2016. As all of the thoughts of everything and everyone that I had lost flooded my mind, I began to 
spiral and was in peril of losing myself. I needed a distraction, something to keep my mind occupied and 
perhaps aid in my coming to terms with the death of my father. I found that distraction in the form of that 
vintage computing collection and the projects that "Little John" had created. It is for that reason alone 
that you are now reading this and seeing those products, which I have decided to release under a 
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 
International</a> <a href=" https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode">(CC BY-SA 4.0)</a> 
License. What this means is that you, or anyone else for that matter, can use the products in almost any 
way that you may desire, even commercially. I am doing all of this to honor the memory of my father, Robert 
Embry Turner, and everyone else that I have lost. I truly hope that these products provide much enjoyment 
to all who discover them. I should point out that I have absolutely no desire to revive the 
<a href="http://www.GIMEchip.com/">GIMEchip.com</a> website, primarily because I do not have all of the 
files necessary to recreate <a href="http://www.GIMEchip.com/">GIMEchip.com</a>. It is very likely that I 
will stumble across some or all of the <a href="http://www.GIMEchip.com/">GIMEchip.com</a> website files as 
I begin to inventory everything that was included with my 2018 Christmas gift from "Big and Little John". I 
also <b>DO NOT</b> wish to invoke the ire of those hackers who targeted my nephew and destroyed his website, 
eBay and PayPal accounts. I will very likely, however, forward the <a href="http://www.GIMEchip.com/">
GIMEchip.com</a> domain to a page on my <a href="http://www.TheLittleEngineers.org/">
http://www.TheLittleEngineers.org/</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OurLittleEngineers/">website</a> 
or perhaps I will forward it to the <a href="https://github.com/TheLittleEngineers?tab=repositories">GitHub
</a> page - I am currently undecided.<br><br>So, there you have it - most of what I wanted to say about how I 
came to posses all of the works of my nephew and his father, as well as their domain name, 
<a href="http://www.GIMEchip.com/">GIMEchip.com</a>. In addition to releasing all of their products under a 
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 
International</a> <a href=" https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode">(CC BY-SA 4.0)</a> 
License, I will also be releasing all of the <b>Zombie Software Systems</b> and <b>Binary Systems</b> 
products under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">identical</a> 
<a href=" https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode">licensing</a> 
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">terms</a>. As I said, I am primarily doing all of 
this to keep my mind occupied. I miss my Father more than any words, written or spoken, could possibly 
express and I keep breaking down, crying like an infant. Focusing on these projects has helped more than I 
could ever have imagined possible. <i>Rest In Peace</i> <b>DAD</b>, I Love and Miss You. I wanted to do 
something to honor my father and to keep his memory alive. Thus, in honor of my Father, Robert Embry Turner 
and all of the others that I have lost, I will be releasing hundreds of products developed by myself and/or 
my son, my nephew "Little John" and/or his father, Zombie Software Systems and Binary Systems under an open 
source license, specifically the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons 
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International</a> 
<a href=" https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode">(CC BY-SA 4.0)</a> License. I have 
absolutely <b>no intention</b> of charging any fees whatsoever in regards to the use of these products. 
Anyone who so desires may manufacture and sell any of these products, though they must state specifically 
that they will be providing any and all support as may be required. However, If you would care to support my 
work, donations are happily accepted, whether they be in the form of funds, vintage computing equipment, 
tools, components, etcetera. I am always in need of such items. I specifically need PAL versions of the TRS80 
Color Computer series (1,2 and 3) as well as NTSC/PAL Dragon D32, D64, D200, etcetera for developmental 
purposes. Monetary donations help to support the hosting needs of 
<a href="http://www.TheLittleEngineers.org/">http://www.TheLittleEngineers.org/</a> as well as the 
development and manufacture of the prototype Printed Circuit Boards.<br><br>Perhaps the easiest and most 
beneficial method of supporting <a href="http://www.TheLittleEngineers.org">The Little Engineers</a>
